            <h2>Brand Origin</h2>
            <p>The theme of transformers wasn’t the original idea. In 1980, “Takara Toys” launched the Dicaclone toy line which were figures of robots and vehicals. Unlike the modern transforms, these robots wern’t alive and were piloted by micro figures. Two years later, “Takara Toys” released a toy line of car-robots which can be converted mech to vechical and the other way around.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the “Tokyo Toy Show” in 1983, “Hasbro” bought the rights and molds to the 28 figures in the Diaclone toy line to import to North America, which would be remade into the transformers, consisting of 18 autobots and 10 decepticons. Working with Marvel editors, “Hasbro” created the backstory and names of the transformer charaters along with breif descriptions, forming the fantasy world of “Transformers.”

            <h2>Figures to Shows</h2>
            <p>To introduce the backstory and charaters in “Transformers,” a three-part cartoon series animated by “Toei Animation” was aired on September 1984, which would be something kids would hold to while growing up. Between the second and third seasons, the first transformers movie came out on 8/8/1986. While it stired a lot of emotion in kids, the movie introduced new charaters in the series and reversions for the 1986 toy release.
            </p>
            <p>In 2007, Micheal Bay directed the first live-action Transformer movie with “Paramount Pichtures”, which won four Oscar rewards. Bay directed follow up movies over the years, Revenge of the Fallen in 2009, Dark of the Moon in 2011, Age of Extinction in 2014, and the latest installment, The Last Knight in 2017.
